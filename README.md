# Linux Video/Microphone Indicator (beta)

![linux-videomicrophone-indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/An0n3m0us/linux-videomicrophone-indicator/main/assets/linux-videomicrophone-indicator.gif)

Basic panel indicator (with animations :P) to show whether:
- Your system microphone is on or off
- Your camera is being used or not

Useful for Zoom/Discord calls where you have not got the window open to see whether your mic/camera is accidentally on or not ;P

(Apologies if the code is ugly; first time using Python GTK)

## Planned features

- Microphone volume level
- Change/disable from panel (requires `sudo` for camera)
